    "Hello, and welcome to this introductory course in Machine Learning for Biomedicine. To kick things off, I'd like to introduce you to [Weka](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/downloading_weka/) one of the first Machine Learning platforms I used when I started out learning ML. Please take a minute and checkout [this great Weka video tutorial](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/downloading_weka/)by Google. I think Weka is a great gateway platform that will undoubtedly take you a long way down these first steps into the ML ecosystem. In fact, Weka is still my goto platform for exploratory data analysis (EDA) which is the topic of today. Follow along the Weka example in the accompanying Lecture slides as we get to know the autism dataset distributed along with this notebook."

    " ## What did we learn about the autism dataset using Weka\n",
    " 1. We have 292 observations and 21 features\n",
    " 2. The authors have developed a model using Demographics and 10 yes/no questions to Score patients for autism.\n",
    " 3. Some features contain missing values.\n",
    " 4. Appears the \"relation\" categorical variable was filled in by hand and has typos.\n",
    " 5. Ethinicity for example is not uniformly sampled. Most patients are white.\n",
    " 6. Most patients are 4yrs old or 11 with few patients in between.\n",
    " 7. 2/3 of patients are Male.\n",
    " 8. We can train a model with 100% accuracy using only the 10 yes/no questions."
